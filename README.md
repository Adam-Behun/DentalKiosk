Dental Kiosk MVP - Idea is to inform the patient of the cost of a visit before they undergo scheduled procedures. /n
This MVP is a React application with Multi-factor authentication, MongoDB, and Stripe API for patient check-in and co-payment collection (tool integrates with Dental Practice Management System to see appointemnts, insurance information, ...) /n
Planning to explore an EDI Clearinghouse integration that would allow for real-time deductible insights helping us achieve price transparency, software-controlled co-pay collection, and office wait-time analyses.
